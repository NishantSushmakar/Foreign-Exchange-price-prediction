# Foreign-Exchange-price-prediction

## Introduction
The foreign exchange rate is the price of one currency in terms of another. Because the foreign
exchange rate compares the currencies of 2 countries, the rate depends on the value of each
currency and, thus, on the economies of both countries. There are 3 primary economic factors
that affect the foreign exchange rate:

1. the relative purchasing power of each currency;
2. the investment opportunities and risks of each country
3. the desirability of the goods and services of each country.

Although other factors can be enumerated, such as the international balance of payments, they
can all be subsumed under these 3 primary economic determiners of the foreign exchange rate.
Foreign Exchange rate is one of the most important means through which a country’s relative
level of economic health is determined. A country's foreign exchange rate provides a window to
its economic stability. It would be great if we could precisely predict how these rates will change
in the far or near future. There are a lot of factors affecting the movement of foreign exchange
rates that it is hard to model . It’s movement depends on several factors like inflation , interest
rate , political stability and economic performance of the country , terms of trade , public debts
and many more.Therefore, predicting stock prices is a difficult job, but we still have valuable
tools which can help us to understand the foreign exchange movement up to some point and in
this project we use Geometric Brownian Motion and Martingale to make these predictions.
The purpose of this project is to study the basic properties of Geometric Brownian Motion and
Martingale Process and make an application of the properties covered. We will use the
Geometric Brownian motion and Martingale Process to predict the Foreign Exchange Rates of
the following five countries : India , China , Japan , United Kingdom and Brazil and then analyze
the results obtained.
